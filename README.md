# busker-ui

A token-first, cross-platform design system for **React** and **React Native**.

## Overview

**busker-ui** is a foundational UI system built to standardize design and UI behavior across web and mobile applications.

The system is designed around:
- **Design tokens** as the single source of truth
- **Typed, headless primitives** for shared logic
- **Platform-specific components** for web and native correctness
- Strong focus on **accessibility**, **scalability**, and **developer experience**

This repository is intentionally structured as a monorepo to support multiple packages and platforms while keeping clear boundaries between concerns.

## Goals

- Provide a shared design language across React and React Native
- Enable safe refactoring through strong typing
- Keep web and native components idiomatic to their platforms
- Support theming (light/dark) and future extensibility
- Be suitable for real-world production usage, not just demos

## Non-goals

- This is not a one-size-fits-all component abstraction
- This is not a web-only UI kit
- This does not aim to hide platform differences
